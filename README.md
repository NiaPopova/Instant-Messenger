#Project Title
Instant Messenger – Prototype of a Real-Time Communication Platform

#Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a prototype of a real-time instant messaging web application that simulates core functionalities of a modern communication platform. The project integrates key aspects such as user authentication, channel-based conversations, message history, and search functionality, providing a solid foundation for future development into a full-scale product.

The project serves as practical experience in full-stack web development, involving front-end interface design and back-end data management. It is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and includes a database structure for storing users, channels, and messages.

#Project Goals
The main goals of the Instant Messenger project are:

✅ Build a dynamic interface that displays a list of public channels and allows switching between them.

✅ Simulate real-time message exchange within channels (messages can be preloaded for demonstration).

✅ Enable user login and registration (initially using fixed credentials).

✅ Design and implement a relational database schema to manage users, messages, and channels.

✅ Create a functional search feature to filter messages within a single channel.

✅ Practice modern web development techniques and team collaboration.
